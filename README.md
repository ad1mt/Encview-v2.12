Encview v2.12B
==============
This is Mark Taylor's personal password manager.

If you stumble across this program, use it at your own risk!

No documentation, no guarantee, no license (public domain).

The only thing that is guaranteed is that there are no backdoors that will allow unwanted decryption.

It works like a very basic text editor, except that all files are encrypted using a proprietary encryption algorithm.
Yes, I know you are not supposed to design your own encryption algorithm, but I did it anyway.

Written using the Free Pascal compiler. Source code available on request.
